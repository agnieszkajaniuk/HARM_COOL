Code HARM-COOL version 486. (2022)
/***********************************************************************************/

Version prepared for the second public release (some bugs fixed in tracers.c).

This version, as of 2022, was
developed since 2012, by Agnieszka Janiuk, Ireneusz Janiuk, and Kostas Sapountzis. 

Code is suppelemented with the EOS functions for the Fermi Gas, under arbitrary degeneracy 
as by Ye-Fei Yuan (see Yuan 2005, Physical Review D, vol. 72, Issue 1, id. 013007),
and produce tables with the equation of state and neutrino cooling in the function of temperature and density.
The physical units adopted in the code are scaled with the black hole mass and density scale in the accretion disk.
Code unit conversion and interpolation over EOS tables is implemented within the conversion scheme between
conserved and primitive variables.

Code makes use of the tracer particles, for the subsequent post-processing of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Output variables on tracers are time, density, temperature, and electron fraction, and r-theta-phi coordinates.

This code version was developed upon the HARM by C. Gammie et al.
It has been extended to 3-Dimensions (phi-r-theta), and tested extensively in 2D and 3D configurations
with various initial conditions.
The output format can be chosen between Ascii standard and HDF5, accprdingly to
its internal configuration.
The code is parallelized with MPI, and can be executed with mpirun command, or with proper batch scripts on supercomputers. It is up to the user to compile and run the code with proper libraries and compiling packages. Sample makefile is provided.
Sample initial condition is using the Fishbone-Moncrief torus solution.

/*******************************************************************************/

Technical setup for compilation requires installing the MPI and hdf5 libraries.
Sample Makefile is provided.
Initial condition is provided with the standard Fishbone-Moncrief solution parameterized as in Gammie et al. (2003), and described in original README below.
To subsitute this initial condition with user-specified file, one must replace the file init.c, added as object in the Makefile.

Grid setups are chosen in decs.h and 2 options are available:
COORDS_GAMMIE
COORDS_CYLINDRIFY_GAMMIE
First are defined according to Gammie et al. (2003) and are the Modified Kerr-Shild coordinates. Second option are the cylindrified coordinates, where a few innermost cells around the pole become cylindrical See details in coord.c.

Resolution: setup in decs.h.
Default resolution is 288x256x256 in r-theta-phi directions.

Grid is distributed into threads in r and phi only. The User must take care for the proper slab division, when specifying the number of computational nodes and CPUs per node.
Standard command for running on 4 CPU on the desktop computer:
> mpirun -np 4 ./harm
For massive computations, it is recommended though to use computer clusters and own batch scripts for execution.

The initial analyze of MPI process execution is saved in stdout.txt.all for all the threads.

Output formats are either ASCII or hdf5 for dumping of the grid variables. Defauls is HDF5, as specified in decs.h by option
HDFDUMP
Here, the user may choose which variables will be stored in the HDF files, by choosing (1) or (0) options. See dump.c for the definitions and details of the stored quantities.
Alternatively, specifically in the 2D (N3=1) simulations, the HDF output may be switched off, and then the code uses standard ASCII output dumps.

The equation of state is specified by the option
#define COOL_EOS 
in decs.h
In default (0) case, the adiabatic gamma-law EOS is used, and parameterised by gamma in the init.c.
If the option
COOL_EOS
is turned on, the nuclear EOS of degenerate relativistic matter is computed, for the range of densities and temperatures.
See details in cooleos.c.
Once the code is executed, the tables of EOS for evey grid point are saved in 
the /cache sub-directory, for the future reading and interpolation.

The storage of tracer particles is activated by option
TRACERSDUMP
in decs.h.
Default setup is no storage of tracers.
If the tracers are stored, the code after it is executed, makes 3 catalogues: /tracers/in, /tracers/out, and 
/tracers/jet,
for the test particles that leave the domain through the inner, or the outer boundary
(in the last case, the jet is defined as a part of outer boundary close to the poles). See details in tracers.c.

The ppm output files in /images directory are turned off (see image.c).

Any questions or bug reports can be sent to:
agnes@cft.edu.pl.

INTRODUCTION:
--------------

HARM is a conservative finite volume approach to solving the hyperbolic partial 
differential equations (PDE).  Even though it was written with general relativistic 
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) specifically in mind, it can solve almost any 
set of hyperbolic equations in conservation form:

dU / dt  +   dF(U) / dx^i   =  S(U)

where, if there is a set of equations, {U,F,S} are all state vectors and 
represent the set of conserved variables, fluxes and sources, respectively. 
There are also primitive variables, P, that are useful when solving hydrodynamic
equations. Often, one only know how to calculate  F  given P, requiring the user
to solve P(U) = U^{-1}(P).   U(P) is a known algebraic set of equations in GRMHD, 
but P(U) is not so we are left to its calculation numerically.  HARM performs most
calculations with P and not with U, since one can derive all other MHD quantities
from P efficiently (calculating P(U) is relatively slow compared to U(P)). Hence, 
the fluxes and sources are implemented here as functions of P. 

The following are the files that comprise HARM.  To the left are their names and 
on the right are short descriptions.

As in most finite volume programs, the numerical domain is discretized into 
parts called "cells."  We assume that these cells are uniformly spaced with 
respect to code coordinates X1 and X2.  One can, however, use a non-uniform
set of coordinates (e.g. "r" and "theta") that are at least C-4 differentiable 
functions of X1,X2 (see bl_coord() in coord.c).  Further, the user may specify 
any regular metric (arbitrary excision is not implemented) at compile-time in 
gcov_func() [coord.c].

HARM was written in a modular way so that methods can be easily 
interchanged.  For instance, different slope limiters can be inserted
into slope_lim() [interp.c], though HARM is currently hard-coded to have 
only two ghost zones per boundary.  Currently only  Lax-Friedrichs-type and 
HLL algorithms are implemented to calculate the numerical flux function, but 
other could be installed by altering fluxcalc() [step_ch.c].  A different 
set of PDE's can be solved by replacing  primtoU(), primtoflux(), source(), vchar() 
[phys.c] and utoprim_2d() [utoprim_2d.c].  If the number of PDE's changed, though, 
one would have to change "NPR" [decs.h] and instances of arrays accessing indexes
beyond current array allocations.

If you wish to use our algorithms and PDE's but want to change the initial
conditions, then you need only change init.c and any compile-time parameters
in decs.h (see below).

STARTING A RUN:
-----------------

To get started, first make sure the settings in "makefile" are valid
for your system.  Once that is done, type the following commands:

	prompt>  make
	prompt>  ./harm 

to run the simulation.  The current setting (128x64 cells) should be 
an acceptable size for any modern workstation.   The code is 
configured to evolve the following initial conditions:

	-- Kerr hole using Kerr-Schild metric, 
		with a=0.9375 (BH normalized spin/M)

	-- Fishbone-Moncrief torus w/ inner edge rin=6M, 
		pressure max. at rmax=12M

	-- Azimuthal vector potential component follows contours of constant 
		density;


The following files will be generated by HARM (using the default settings):

	-- ./ener.out:    accretion rates of rest-mass, total energy and
				 angular momentum onto the black hole 
				(plus other quantities, see diag.c for details)


	-- ./dumps/dump[000-???] :   double-precision, plain text output of 
					grid functions (see dump.c for details)


	-- ./images/im_*_[0000-????].ppm  : dynamically-scaled snapshots of rho, 
						bsq, u, the lorentz factor, 
						and their logarithms at higher
						time resolution than the "dumps".
						Use ImageMagick's "display" command 
						to view, and ppm2fli (see below) to 
						animate.




Parameters that you may want to immediately adjust are: 

decs.h:    N1, N2  =  number of cells in the X1 and X2 directions, respectively. 
                      (X1 is the radial-going direction, X2 is the poloidal-going one).


init.c:     a   =  spin of the black hole (spatial dimensions scale w/ black hole mass, 
				i.e. M_BH = 1);

	    gam = adiabatic index for fluid;
       

	    rin  = radial position of inner edge of torus;
	    rmax = radial position of pressure maximum;
            beta = initial value of  2 P_max / b_max^2 
	    Rout = radial coordinate of outer numerical boundary;
	    tf   = end time of solution in units of black hole mass;
	    DTd  = frequency of writing dump files in units of M 
	    DTi  = frequency of writing image files in units of M

OUTPUT FORMATS:
-----------------

The user has a choice of the types of images HARM makes: PPM or R8.  
The former is a standard image format, see "man ppm" or the web for more
details.  R8 is an unmapped format of 1-bit in "color" depth, see image_r8()
of image.c for details.  R8 images are smaller in size since they do not
provide the color scheme.  Their downside is that after generating the R8
images, one must convert them to PPM or some other format with a 
user-supplied parsing program.  We have left this R8 conversion utility 
as an exercise for the user, but have provided the PPM format for those 
of you who are lazy and want to see pictures immediately. 


ppm: 
	-- animate ppm files with either "convert im_lrho*.ppm im_lrho.gif" or use 
            ppm2fli (http://vento.pi.tu-berlin.de/ppm2fli/main.html)


r8: 
	-- raw format that can be easily converted to a ppm file.  



The format of the dump files can be easily gleaned from dump() in dump.c .
